Recursion means to try every possible values.
-------------------------------------------------------------
RECURSION => Recursion + Memoization => Tabulation (Use base cases of Recursion + Memoization for dp[0]) => Space Optimization(by using prev2, prev, curr).
-------------------------------------------------------------
For subsequences problems, use "pick & not-pick" with recursion.
-------------------------------------------------------------
If there are infinite number of supplies, multiple usage of same thing, then f(idx, T-coins[idx]) will be used. Here, idx is not changing to idx-1(that's the IMPORTANT
OBSERVATION). Keeping idx means we are selecting the same coin/item again n again as per our requirement.
