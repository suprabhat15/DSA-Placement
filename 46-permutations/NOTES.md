Approach 1 
-----------
`TC -> O(n!) * O(n)`
n! for all the permutations and n for running loop.
 
` SC -> O(n) + O(n)`
 n for helper vector and another n for freq. array.
 
 Approach 2
 -----------
 `TC -> O(n!) * O(n)`
n! for all the permutations and n for running loop.
 
` SC -> O(1)`
as we are not using any external spaces. Just by swapping the elements of given vector, we are getting the answer.
